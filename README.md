# MulleObjCCalendarFoundation

This is a [mulle-sde](https://mulle-sde.github.io/) project.

It has it's own virtual environment, that will be automatically setup for you
once you enter it with:

```
mulle-sde MulleObjCCalendarFoundation
```

Now you can let **mulle-sde** fetch the required dependencies and build the
project for you:

```

```
