## MANDATORY FIRST STEPS - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY

🚨 **CRITICAL: YOU MUST DO THIS AT THE START OF EVERY CHAT SESSION** 🚨

DO NOT skip these steps. DO NOT treat them as optional. DO NOT proceed with any
task until you have completed ALL of these commands in order:

### Step 1: REQUIRED - Enable vibecoding and read help

```bash
mulle-sde vibecoding on
mulle-sde help
```

### Step 2: REQUIRED - Read howto and api help

```bash
mulle-sde howto help
mulle-sde api help
```

### Step 3: REQUIRED - List available commands and howtos

```bash
mulle-sde commands
mulle-sde howto list
```

**REMEMBER**: `mulle-sde howto` is THE tool for getting work done in this
project. Use it FIRST before attempting any task manually.


## MANDATORY BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE

🚨 **YOU MUST RUN THIS COMMAND BEFORE WRITING OR MODIFYING ANY CODE** 🚨

```bash
value="$(mulle-sde env get PROJECT_DIALECT)"
value="${value:-$(mulle-sde env get PROJECT_LANGUAGE)}"
mulle-sde howto show --keyword styleguide --keyword "${value}"
```

This gets the style information for the project. It is NOT optional.

-   Never call -alloc/init or +new without -autorelease except in -init
    methods, were you should avoid -autorelease

### Properties

-   Convert all property reads and writes to explicit message sends.

    -   **Write:** `[self setProperty:value]` instead of `self.property = value`
-   Do not use class properties

-   Do not use `@package`, `@import`, `@synthesize`
-   Use `BOOL` not `bool`
-   Do not use `nullable`
-   Do not use generics like `NSArray <NSString *>`
-   Do not use class extensions like `@implementation()`
-   Do not define instance varibals in `@implementation` only in `@interface`

## CMake Guidelines

Changes to the build system must be done with `mulle-sde`. Only edit CMake
files as a  _very_ last resort and under user guidance.
